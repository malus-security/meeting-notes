At this point, we have everything working.

I can do all from the command line.
There are a bunch of applications, some of which have GUI, all of work.
There are some settings that I am using.

LP: I'm using an M1 build.

Environment variation: compiler version.

Leave for later extending the application set.

## TODOs

Use macOS AMR64 chips / architecture.

LP: Can we use different compiler / XCode version on the same system?

LP: Can we use a macOS virtual machine (either on your system or remotely)?

LP: Test on the remote MacMini on ARM64.

LP: Investigate other sources of non-determinism.

LP: Try on different iOS models.
