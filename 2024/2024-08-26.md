## Discussions

### Cristi Radu

CR: I have a MacBook that I can now use natively for the investigation.

CR: I'm looking into understanding the way TCC works.
I did a parsing of the database file `TCC.db`.
I use online resources to get the semantics of each column in the database.

RD: The aim is to get a full picture of TCC and then see where it has flaws.

RD: Are you investigating TCC on macOS or iOS?

CR: Currently on iOS.

RD: Aim to extract the agent / process / daemon that does the actual modification of the `TCC.db` file.

### Cosmin Grigore

CG: There are not actual updates from our side, but I'm wondering about the potential clashes between me and Gabriel.

RD: I will arrange a meeting between the 4 of us, but I don't think there's conflict.

## TODOs and Decisions

RD: Arrange meeting with Cosmin, Gabi and Andrei on next steps for UI Exerciser.

CR: Items to do:

1. Draft research report.
1. Find out what is the process that updates the `TCC.db` file.
1. Answer to "What service / process is accesing resource X?" and "What resources is service / process Y able to access?" - based on the values in the TCC.db.
1. Construct a full view of access control from the `TCC.db` that we can then subject to investigation.
