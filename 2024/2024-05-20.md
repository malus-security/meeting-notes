RP: I tested on some services on the phone.
It works on simple applications.

I need to update the way breakpointing works for services.

You metric should be coverage of applications, how many applications can work with the GDB introspection-based infrastructure.

AS: I found multiple fuzzers.

1. simple
1. a more complicated one
1. syzkaller

AS: I went for the 2nd option.

RD: First test it as a random / dumb fuzzer.
Then move on with adding coverage.

RD: Get some histograms on the syscalls / operations that are being captured.
