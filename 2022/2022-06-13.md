## Discussions

DC: I tried to make the CVE to run on iOS.
I'm trying to open a shell.

DC: This PoC attaches an XPC to an existing service.

RD: The best course of action is first to get this working on a jailbroken device.
Then you could aim to get it working on a stock device.

RD: Let's meet on Wednesday morning to give you a jailbroken iOS device.

AA: I've worked on the report.

RD: Let's decide, in two weeks time, if we are going to go for Cypher Query Language.

RP: I found a library that works on Linux on compressing / decompressing.

RD: Ideally, in July, we would have a draft version of the iOS 15 kernel cache extraction.

## TODOs

AA: Create PR with the fixes for `#` in sandscout.

AA: Further investigate Cypher Query Language for Sandscout.

DC: Work on jailbroken device.

RD: Provide jailbroken device to DC.

RP: Create PR with README on kernel cache format.

RP: Work on decompressing kernelcache on Linux.
