RP: I started integrating the scripts into a single one.
I added an argument to decompress argument.

AG: I'm using to integrate the UI exerciser with Flask and provide a REST API.
I want to create an application, not a script for users.
I want to have an interactive application.

AG: I'm not making assumptions about the source code of your application.
It's your choice on how you design it.

At this point, I'm walking the application and invoking `dot-py`.
